Python Interface for veekun-pokedex


Python Pokedex uses a 50MB SQLite3 Database called veekun-pokedex by user veekun:

Website: https://veekun.com
Github: https://github.com/veekun

While Veekun's site is perfect for all your pokemon knowledge, I used it as a project starting in Oct 2017 to build a python interface for it. 

PythonPokedex is a Work in Progress piece currently on version 0.1, it is a text based interface for the DB

Plans for v1.0:

Web interface using Python's Flask framework to access the information in a more user friendly manner.


Current Dev Branch project: is as detailed(ish) in v1.0 plans, I am currently in the VERY early stages of the flask webpage.
